00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's talk business.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.090
This guy comes to town every Thursday, are
you free Thursday?

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.220
Yes, I'm free Tuesday.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
You can't stop what you can't see.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.840
This guy came from the outside, it was a
pro.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.120
It was. In the art of the kill, Leon was the
master somebody coming up.

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.390
Somebody serious? He never missed a hit.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.090
He never got caught.

9
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.470
You're indestructible.

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.270
Pull it, slide off, you play with a.

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.190
And above all else, he never had a reason to
care.

12
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.110
Until now.

13
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.070
I like this car little moments before the
storm.

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.690
My family was shot down by DEA officers.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:03.570
Three kids here. One of them is missing,
finding himself after pleas

16
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.830
from the director of La Femme Nikita will
die tonight.

17
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.590
I can feel an innocent girl with no one else
to turn to.

18
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.350
What exactly do you do for a living?

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.540
Gina you mean you're hit man called.

20
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.330
Perfect assassin

21
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.710
Tweeted out. I want to get those dirtbags
killed, my brother with someone to finally

22
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.060
believe in changing.

23
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.730
Remember that early on, I well, they're about
to come face to face with the cop

24
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.380
Who's crossed the line.

25
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.140
Bring me everyone. Do you mean everyone?
