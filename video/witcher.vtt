1
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.570
I've heard tales of your kind, which.

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.580
A mutant. Created by magic.

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.910
Roaming the continent.

4
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.310
We don't want your kind in hunting monsters.

5
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.120
For a price, I thought you'd have fangs or
horns or something.

6
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.860
I had them filed down.

7
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690
People call you a monster to.

8
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.550
Why not kill them, because I what they say
about all of our choices through our

9
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.620
destinies, Kloser.

10
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.450
Out there, there's two.

11
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.350
Carol, to prevent.

12
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.980
Judgment, they say, which is can't feel human
emotion.

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.550
What do you believe, this evil?

14
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.320
Lessa. Great, great.

15
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.820
And maybe it's all the same.

16
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.490
Princess Scrilla.

17
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.130
Does your own destiny?

18
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.220
I can't protect.

19
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.100
If you dismiss.

20
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.370
You were unleash.

21
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.150
Calamity.

22
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.990
I'll take that chance.
